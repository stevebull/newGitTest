20140921
05:12 EDT = 12:12 Lefkes, Paros, Greece
created a 2nd free new site "smstest" w/ install of Drupal 6key_for_pantheon.txt
smstest.pantheon.com

I tried to use connection mode SFTP to upload/create site content and although I was finally able to create a key [key_for_pantheon.txt] on my MacBook Pro following command line instructions my FETCH was unable to digest the key to match my intent

So now I will try the GIT method, I have git installed
Stephens-MacBook-Pro:~ aeolus$ git --version
git version 1.8.5.2 (Apple Git-48)

06:06 i was unable to load my SSH key into my account. I left a trouble ticket about the matter.

returning to how to tutorials on git + github

command git clone https://github.com/stevebull/newGitTest.git 
creates a folder /Documents/newGitHub/ and stores stuff from github.com/stevebull/newGitTest
i notice the videomaker is using iTerm + SUblimeText apps so I added both
some git commands from tutorial
git commit -m "added index.html" (-m means with message within "" to github repository)
git status
git push
git add index.html (<> or filename means adding only the file within directory to github repository)
git add . (. means add all in directory to github repository)
git add -A (-A means add ALL in directory to github repository)
git pull (pulls all file within a github repository; shared use)
git commit -m "made changes" (terribly generic, just useful in this tutorial
git (shows a list of all commands)
if you ever #git commit alone you may need to get out terminal screen > esc key > then ;wq < uh huh
git commit is USEFUL for a multi line commit message

WORK FLOW (from tutorial video)
beginning of everyday
git pull (to get everyone's changes)
